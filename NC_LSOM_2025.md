4th edition of Nanded City (NC) LSoM, our community marathon event, held on Sunday,
23rd March 2025. This year’s event coincided with Shaheed Diwas, and we dedicated
the run to honoring the brave martyrs who laid down their lives for our Maatrubhumi.

Here are some key highlights from the event:

1. Participation of 2000+ individuals, from toddlers to senior citizens.
2. Sponsorship for 50 ZP school children, ensuring they could experience the joy of running.
3. A strong emphasis on sustainability, with a plastic-free event using steel utensils.
4. Specialized support from physiotherapists and doctors to assist runners.

We are incredibly proud to have organized yet another LSoM that participants truly enjoyed.

We sincerely thank you for allowing us to create an experience that will be
cherished for a long time. This event was entirely community-driven, with 160+
volunteers from NCRunners and support from 15 local sponsors, ensuring we
delivered a high-quality event at just ₹200 per runner.
