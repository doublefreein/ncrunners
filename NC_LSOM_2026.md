# NC LSoM 2026

5th edition of Nanded City (NC) LSoM, our community marathon event, held on Sunday,
29th March 2026.

The theme for this year's NC LSoM is "Digital Detox".

Distances of 3 km, 5 km, 10 km and 15 km are available.

This entire month of March we will be doing

1. We grow our community by inviting new members to join us and become runners.
2. Promoting Running and its benefits to the local community of runners.

## How to digital detox

1. Dont let devices control you
    * Be in control of your time and attention.
    * Dont fall prey to algorithm traps.
2. Be in real word more than your virtual world.
    * Make friends in real world rather than on social media.
    * Sweat is real and physical activity is good for you.
