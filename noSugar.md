# No Sugar Fools Challenge

21 Days: Count your own days.

### Why no sugar?
Sugar is a quick form of energy. When you eat sugar, your body burns it first and does not bother to use stored fat. Excess energy gets stored as fat. We don't need sugar. Remember, a few years back, sugar was only used on special festival days. Pedha, Srikhanda, and jilbab ladu were festival foods only. Now, we have a problem of abundance. Sugar and simple carbohydrates are linked to obesity and heart disease. 

### Who can join?
